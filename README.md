# Identifying-Customer-Segments

In this project, Bertelsmann partners AZ Direct and Arvato Financial Solutions have provided two datasets one with demographic information about the people of Germany, and one with that same information for customers of a mail-order sales company. I have looked at relationships between demographics features, organized the population into clusters, and saw how prevalent customers are in each of the segments obtained.
